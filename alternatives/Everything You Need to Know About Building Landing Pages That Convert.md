# <title>Everything You Need to Know About Building Landing Pages That Convert</title>

<article>

## What is a Landing Page?

A landing page is a dedicated webpage designed with a single, specific goal in mind. It serves as your "one-page storefront," focusing on converting visitors into customers, subscribers, or leads. Unlike a traditional website with multiple pages, a landing page removes distractions and guides visitors toward a clear call-to-action (CTA).

For example, a company running a limited-time promotion for a new product might create a landing page highlighting the product’s benefits with compelling visuals and persuasive copy. Traffic is driven to the page through email marketing and social media ads. The page’s success is measured by how many visitors provide their contact details, indicating their interest in the promotion.

## How Do Landing Pages Work?

Landing pages excel at lead generation because they’re built with a single, focused purpose: driving visitors to take action. Unlike websites that aim to provide a broad range of information, landing pages are designed to convert, making them more effective at turning visitors into leads.

### Key Differences Between Websites and Landing Pages
- **Websites**: Serve as a one-stop shop for information, catering to diverse audiences.  
- **Landing Pages**: Function as personalized invitations, addressing a specific audience and objective.  

This focused approach makes landing pages highly engaging and persuasive, increasing the likelihood of conversions.

## Types of Landing Pages

There are two main types of landing pages, each designed for a unique purpose:

### 1. Lead Generation Landing Pages
Also known as "lead capture" pages, these are designed to collect information from potential customers. They typically feature forms that request contact details, such as:
- Name
- Email address
- Phone number  
Additional fields, like age or job title, may also be included.

#### Benefits:
1. **Nurturing Leads**: The collected data allows you to connect with interested individuals and build relationships.  
2. **Targeted Marketing**: Analyze the data to personalize your marketing efforts and target audiences most likely to convert.

Example: A mortgage lead generation page collects user data for personalized follow-ups.

### 2. Click-Through Landing Pages
These pages focus on driving immediate action. They feature prominent CTAs, such as "Shop Now" or "Schedule a Demo," which redirect users to complete specific tasks like making a purchase or booking a meeting.

- **Common Use Cases**: E-commerce sales or service bookings.
- **Content**: Includes product details or testimonials to entice clicks.
