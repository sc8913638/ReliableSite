## **What is Affiliate Marketing?**

Affiliate marketing is a performance-based marketing strategy where you earn a commission by promoting a company’s products or services. Affiliates are given a unique referral link to track sales and conversions. For every successful transaction made through your link, you get paid.

Affiliate programs typically offer two types of commission structures:
1. **One-time commissions**: A fixed payout for each sale or lead.
2. **Recurring commissions**: A percentage of revenue paid out for as long as the customer remains subscribed.

For long-term profitability, recurring commissions are often preferred because they create a stable passive income stream.
