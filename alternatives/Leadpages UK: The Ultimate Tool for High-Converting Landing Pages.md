#### 2. LeadBoxes for Optimized Lead Capture
LeadBoxes are customizable pop-ups that can appear on your website, blogs, or other digital platforms. These pop-ups can be triggered by user actions (like clicking a button) or time delays, making them ideal for engaging users at the right moment. The Exit Intent LeadBox is especially powerful, capturing leads just as theyâ€™re about to leave your site.

#### 3. Native Ad Creation
With Leadpages, you can create and manage Facebook and Instagram ads directly within the platform. This feature simplifies your workflow by pulling content from your landing page to create compelling ads that drive traffic. Plus, Leadpages automatically integrates Facebook Pixel for retargeting and analytics.

#### 4. A/B Testing for Optimization
Split testing is critical for maximizing conversions. Leadpages includes an easy-to-use A/B testing feature, allowing you to compare different versions of your landing pages and determine which design, copy, or layout performs best.

#### 5. Seamless Integrations
Leadpages integrates with a variety of tools to enhance your marketing and sales processes. For instance:
- **Email Marketing Tools:** Automatically add leads to your email lists for follow-up sequences.
- **E-commerce Platforms:** Integrate with Shopify to streamline your sales funnel by including shopping carts and buy buttons directly on your landing pages.
